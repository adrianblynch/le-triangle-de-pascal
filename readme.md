# Le Triangle de Pascal

## Why?

Why not?! It was in a list of "_Interview tests for JavaScript developers_" so I gave it a go.

## But why?

To exercise the mind!

## Install

`npm install le-triangle-de-pascal`

## Usage

```
var ltdp = require('le-triangle-de-pascal')

console.log(ltdp(5))
```

Results in:

```
[[1][1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
```

Or if you'd like the pretty version:

```
[
      [1]
     [1,1],
    [1,2,1],
   [1,3,3,1],
  [1,4,6,4,1]
]
```

## Todo

- Make an option for prettying up the output (will never get around to it)
